## Activating an Intent

You should make the majority of content edits to your Intent while it is still INACTIVE.

Once the Intent is ready to be shown to the Public, click on the "Activate Intent" button in the Intent Editor page![](../../.gitbook/assets/62.png)

Now, you will be able to trigger this Intent from the Public Chat UI.

## Deactivating an Intent

When an Intent's response is no longer relevant and you want to disable it from being triggered on the Public Chat UI, you should Deactivate it.

1. In the Intent Editor, click on the "..." button on the top right side of the screen
2. In the menu that appears, click on "Deactivate Intent"

## Archiving an Intent

If you do not intend to Reactivate an Intent, you can Archive it for future reference. This is a good way to "clean-up' your Bot's Knowledge Base by keeping only relevant Intents at the foreground.

To Archive an Intent, it must first be INACTIVE

1. In the Intent Editor, click on the "..." button on the top right side of the screen
2. In the menu that appears, click on "Archive Intent"

## Unarchiving an Intent

1. In the Intent Editor, click on the "..." button on the top right side of the screen
2. In the menu that appears, click on "Unarchive Intent"

## Deleting an Intent

To delete an Intent, it must first be Archived.

1. In the Intent Editor, click on the "..." button on the top right side of the screen
2. In the menu that appears, click on "Delete Intent"
