# What is Converse?

TAIGER Converse is a Conversation AI Platform that allows you to build and manage Bots \(also known as Virtual Assistants\). Bots are autonomous, always-on representatives of your business that can help service your Customers or Employees needs across a wide variety of scenarios. For example, a HR Bot can be configured to help your employees process their expense claims and a Customer Support Bot can help answer frequently asked questions and reset a customer's account password.

TAIGER Converse allows you to create engaging conversation experiences, and allow your customers & employees to become more productive. As chat has become ubiquitous and accessible to users of all skill levels, no training is required for end-users to interact with Bots you create.

This User Guide is meant for Administrators of Converse Bots, who will create, configure and train Bots to service the target end-users.
